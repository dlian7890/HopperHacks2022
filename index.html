          <p>
            Smoking has been proven to cause lung disease by damaging airways
            and the air sacs in the lungs. Lung diseases that are linked to
            smoking are Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease, emphysema and
            chronic bronchitis. Cigarette Smoking has been found to cause most
            cases of lung cancer and combined with asthma, can trigger an asthma
            attack or make it worse.

          <h2><i class="fa-solid fa-bolt"></i></i> Electronic Cigarettes</h2>
          <p>
            Electronic Cigarettes or E-Cigs have been shown to expose the user
            to fewer toxicants than smoking tobacco cigarettes but the
            healthiest option is to not vape or smoke. E-cigarettes can contain
            harmful ingredients including particles that can be inhaled deep
            into the lungs, flavorants such as diacetyl, a chemical linked to
            serious lung disease.

            and heavy metals such as nickel, tin, and lead. E-Cigs have been
            rising in popularity with a younger crowd but it has been shown that
            adolescent exposure to nicotine can cause addiction and harm the
            developing brain.
